# chat(ml)

This is a simple website that is built on react and typescript. The whole idea was for me to relearn react and also Machine learning concepts and I thought why not combine the two. Also, I wanted to give a theme that matched the idea of the website, and since LLMs are the current trend, I thought of using a chat theme.

There is nothing fancy about this website, as there is no backend, and it is just a static website. Even though it is a static website, you can still use it for uploading files and perform data analysis(as of now).
