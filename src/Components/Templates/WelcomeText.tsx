            <p>
              We're thrilled to have you here! At chatML, you can dive into machine learning directly in your browser, 
              no backend required. Our platform uses <b>Numts</b>, a 2D NumPy variant for TypeScript, 
              to bring powerful machine learning tools to the frontend. This means all computations and models run client-side,
              allowing you to experiment, learn, and build without needing a separate server.
            </p>
            <p>
            Whether you're just starting with machine learning or you're a seasoned pro, ML-Chat makes it easy to 
            interact with models, run experiments, and explore the fascinating world of AIâ€”all in a conversational format.
            </p>

            <ul class='list-inside list-disc'><b>What can you do here?</b>
              <li>Build and train machine learning models directly in TypeScript.</li>
              <li>Use interactive conversations to query and experiment with your models.</li>
              <li>Explore built-in tools and algorithms to get hands-on experience.</li>
            </ul>
